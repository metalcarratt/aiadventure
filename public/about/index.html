    <h1>About - AI Adventure</h1>
    <p>
        AI Adventure was made using <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">Chat GPT</a>
        and <a href="https://leonardo.ai/" target="_blank">Leonardo.AI</a>, both tools for creating
        AI generated content.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chat GPT was used for designing the story, challenges and choices. It was
        also used to come up with prompts for creating the images. In some cases,
        such as for 'Workplace Romance', it was mostly used for idea generation
        and the actual text, choices, and how those choices resulted in different
        outcomes was my own work. In other cases, such as 'Stranded Love Island',
        Chat GPT was used to generate the script itself, including all choices and
        endings. Some tidy up was required to make it work at the end, especially
        with the endings, but almost all text in the game was provided by Chat GPT.
    </p>
    <p>
        Leonardo.AI was used to generate the images based on the prompts provided by
        Chat GPT. There was some work to fine tune prompts, and images of characters
        usually needed tidying up in gimp (to remove backgrounds and clip).

        The AI Adventures game itself was made using Vue.js. The source code is public
        and can be viewed here: <a href="https://github.com/metalcarratt/aiadventure" target="_blank">
